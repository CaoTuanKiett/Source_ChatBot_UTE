## ⚙️ TypeScript Support for `.vue` Imports  

By default, TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports. To address this:  
1. Replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking.  
2. Use the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension in your editor to make TypeScript aware of `.vue` types.
